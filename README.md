User-Story

As a user, I want to be able to start using the app by creating a new list.
I want to be able to have a list title (that I can edit).
Then I want to add items in to the list.
This list should be able to be viewed/edited later by me, edit including adding new items.
I also want to be able to delete the list I've made.
